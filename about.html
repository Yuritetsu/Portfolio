<h1>Meet Rona, Filipino-American from Fremont, California</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an immigrant, army veteran, chef, pastry chef, small business owner, cat mom, and plant mom. My hobbies include drawing, taking care of my plants, playing video games, punch needling, among other things. Coding was always a foreign languange to me with my profesional background being mostly in the Culinary field and recently, purchasing. I decided to learn coding in hopes in changing my career from Culinary to Web Development.</p>
<h2>Professional Background</h2>
<p>I have worked mainly in the culinary field in the past couple years. The first culinary job I ever had was back in 2008 as a server/cook. I worked in different type of businesses since then, including as a cook in a Skilled Nursing Facility, Dietary Service Supervisor Assistant at another Skilled Nursding Facility, Manager at a fast food chain, Manager at 3 different bakery chains, baker at a tech company and now in culinary purchasing. </p>
<h2>Personal Goals</h2>
<p>Living in California, owning a home sounds like an unattainable goal. It is still something I wish to achieve. I was hoping that being in a tech industry dense State, that maybe I can reach my goal by being in the tech field.</p>
