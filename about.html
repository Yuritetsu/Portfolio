<h1>Meet Rona, Filipino-American from Fremont, California</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an immigrant, army veteran, chef, pastry chef, small business owner, cat mom, and plant mom. My hobbies include drawing, taking care of my plants, playing video games, punch needling, among other things. Coding was always a foreign languange to me with my profesional background being mostly in the Culinary field and recently, purchasing. I decided to learn coding in hopes in changing my career from Culinary to Web Development.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>I like to draw silly animals and characters on my procreate in my spare time. I have been drawing since I was very young and for a long time, this is what I wanted as a career. I ended up deciding to draw on the side for my small business.</p>

<h3>Baking/Cooking</h3>
<p>I have always loved to cook. I remember the times when I was in gradeschool I would cook my own lunch before school. I would wake up before my mom and would make myself two pieces of bacon and a cup of rice. Fast forward to a couple years later I took interest in baking when my aunt showed me how to make boxed cookies. I thought it was the most amazing thing that I can make my own cookies at home. 
    
<p>Eventually due to my love for cooking, I did work in restaurants as a server and then cook. A couple years past, I decided I wanted to bake as a profession so I worked in a couple chain bakeries until I ended up opening my small baking business back in 2016.</p> am a stronger baker than I am a cook but I do enjoy both.</p>

<h3>Other Small Hobbies:</h3>
<p>Punch needling, playing bass guitar, video games, reading manga and watching anime, </p>

<h2>Academic Goals</h2>
<p>To finish the web development bootcamp with flying colors!</p>
